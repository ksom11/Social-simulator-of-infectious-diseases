模拟在传染病大流行时，社会层面变化。当然本项目更聚焦于每个普通人的影响，不仅是得病、隔离、病死、恢复，也包括每日收入、花费的模拟，每个人都可能破产。这些众多的细节能更好的呈现出疫情流行的社会是如何的。模拟主要逻辑在于Person.cs中，使得模拟大量变量的情况下代码更加简洁，虽然会降低一些性能，但这是可以牺牲的。

Simulate the change of social level during the epidemic of infectious diseases. Of course, this project focuses more on the impact of every ordinary person, not only the illness, isolation, death and recovery, but also the simulation of daily income and expenditure. Everyone may go bankrupt. These numerous details can better show how the epidemic society is.The main logic of simulation is in Person.cs, which makes the code more concise when simulating a large number of variables. Although it will reduce some performance, it can be sacrificed.
